# Sensing Temperature and Humidity on the Local Network

This project focuses on sensing temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor and a NodeMCU microcontroller in a local network. The collected data is then displayed using the Processing software, providing a real-time visualization of environmental conditions.

## Overview

In this project, we use a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and a NodeMCU microcontroller to transmit the data over a local network. The data is then visualized using the Processing software, allowing users to monitor environmental conditions in real-time.

### Project Objectives

- To learn about IoT sensors and their integration with microcontrollers.
- To develop a system for monitoring temperature and humidity over a local network.
- To visualize the collected data using Processing software.

## Hardware and Software Requirements
